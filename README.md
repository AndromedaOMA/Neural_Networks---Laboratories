<h1 id="assignment-5" align="left">Assignment_5:</h1>

<h3 align="left">Here we have the requirement:</h3>

Implement and train a neural network using the Q learning algorithm to control an agent in the Flappy Bird game.

<h3 align="left">Environment:</h3>

You can use a Flappy Bird environment from [here](https://pypi.org/project/flappy-bird-gymnasium/) or [here](https://github.com/Talendar/flappy-bird-gym) or another environment. Why not create your own? If you use a pre-made environment, make sure you can render the environment and interact with it.

<h3 align="left">Specifications:</h3>

You can train the model directly on images (the model receives the pixels) or you can extract helpful features. Based on the input you are using for the model, the maximum score is capped to:

- 20 points: if you provide the game state directly (this might include positions of the pipes, bird, direction, simple distances)
- 25 points: if you provide preprocessed features (this might include more complex features extracted from the image: e.g. sensors/lidar for the bird)
- 30 points: if you use the image as input, eventually preprocessed, if needed (resizing, grayscale conversion, thresholding, dilation, erosion, background removal, etc.)

It is not necessary to implement the neural network from scratch (you can use PyTorch), but you must implement the Q learning algorithm.

<h3 align="left">Here we have the requirement:</h3>

Participate in the following Kaggle competition -> https://www.kaggle.com/t/1422c0d3298e447aa6e50db3543b6870.
Use PyTorch to create a training Pipeline and do several experiments on the MNIST dataset, following the rules. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: Implement and train a Residual Neural Network(ResNet)!
</br>

<h3 align="left">How does it work?</h3>

Built and implemented the residual blocks, which in turn use the BatchNorm2d normalization and the GELU activation function, that will process the images from the MNIST dataset, which will be downloaded and uploaded in mini-batches, in order to then resize the outputs of these layers. Also built the fully connected layers that serve to provide the desired predictions. Finally the backpropagation process will be applied to adjust the weights/train of the ResNet.

<h3 align="left">The logic behind the code:</h3>

The ResNet contains one convolutional layer of 16 channels followed by a 2D batch normalization and ReLU activation function, further, two residual blocks are implemented, each with 16 or 32 channels, the last one having a stride equal to 2. To make this possible, a second script "residual_block.py" will help implement the residual blocks that will take into account the residual connections that "skip" one or more layers.

The fully connected neural network contains a number of two hidden layers that help to process the prediction of the entire artificial neural network. Between the two layers we used a Dropout regularization to reduce the possibility of overfitting and the ReLU activation function.

From the optimization point of view, we will use the Adam optimizer and the CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts learning rate scheduler, which adjusts the learning rate using a cosine annealing strategy with periodic restarts. This technique helps escape local minima by periodically increasing the learning rate back to a higher value.

The data set was processed/transformed using RandomAffine for easy modification of these data, converted to tensors and normalized.

The Residual Neural Network achieves 99.71% test accuracy. The model that achieved this accuracy is saved in the file "best_model.pth". I also saved the prediction of the convolutional network in the file "submission.csv".

The convolutional neural network contains 2 convolutional layers followed by one Pooling layer each. The first convolution layer will contain 16 channels and the second layer will contain 32 channels. The transition from each convolution layer to the pooling layer is processed and filtered by means of a ReLU activation function and BatchNorm2d normalization.

<h3 align="left">How does it work?</h3>

We will download and upload the MNIST dataset data in mini-batches to a classical fully connected neural network. Finally we will apply the backpropagation process to adjust the weights/train the neural network.

<h3 align="left">The logic behind the code:</h3>

The neural network contains a number of five hidden layers that help to process the prediction of the entire artificial neural network. Between these layers we will use Dropout regularizations to reduce the possibility of overfitting and LeakyReLU activation functions, as well as BatchNorm1d normalization to speed up the training process.

From the optimization point of view, we will use the Adam optimizer and the OneCycleLR learning rate scheduler, which adjusts the learning rate and optionally momentum during training to achieve faster convergence and better generalization.

The data set was processed/transformed using RandomAffine for easy modification of these data, converted to tensors and normalized.

The neural network achieves 99.40% test accuracy. The model that achieved this accuracy is saved in the file "best_model.pth". I also saved the prediction of the convolutional network in the file "submission_99.40.csv".

<h1 id="assignment-3" align="left">Assignment_3:</h1>

<h3 align="left">Here we have the requirement:</h3>

Implement a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) and the Backpropagation algorithm
using NumPy operations. 

The MLP architecture should consist of 784 input
neurons, 100 hidden neurons, and 10 output neurons. 

Use the MNIST dataset
to evaluate your implementation. Measure the accuracy for both training and
validation. The tasks for this assignment and their respective points are as
follows:
  1. Implement forward propagation. (1 points)
  2. Implement the backpropagation algorithm using the chain rule. Refer to
  the provided resources. (15 points implementation + explanation)
  3. Utilize batched operations for enhanced efficiency. (4 points)
  4. You must achieve at least 95% accuracy on the validation split of the
  MNIST dataset, in 5-6 minutes. (5 points)
  5. Choose one: (5 points)
     
    (a) Implement dropout on the hidden layer.
    
    (b) Implement L1 or L2 regularization.
    
    (c) Create a dynamic learning rate scheduler that decays the learning rate when training metrics reach a plateau.

Things you may try to improve the accuracy:

  â€¢ Weight initialization
  
  â€¢ Changing the learning rate
  
  â€¢ Normalizing and shuffling the training data
  
  â€¢ Dropout and other forms of regularization
  
Bonus : Strive for higher accuracy (not graded, but always try to be better).

<h3 align="left">How does it work?</h3>

We have implemented and trained a first Neural Network using the NumPy library. It comes with a simplistic and quite efficient content, as the statement above requires: an input layer (784), a hidden layer (100) and an output layer (10).

Every neural layer, method, optimizer and activation function will be implemented from scratch.

<h3 align="left">The logic behind the code:</h3>

The multi layer network uses a ReLU activation function for modeling and processing and Softmax which will adjust the final results during the Forward propagation process. Time during which the partial derivatives of these functions will be used during the Back propagation process.

The weights will be initialized using the He method to avoid blocking the neural network. It helps stabilize the variance of activations across layers, leading to better convergence during training.

From the dataset point of view, I have implemented a method that will generate batches from the entire dataset and shuffle them.

The Neural Network achieves 97% test accuracy.

<h1 id="assignment-2" align="left">Assignment_2:</h1>

<h3 align="left">Here we have the requirement:</h3>

In this exercise, you are tasked with implementing both the forward and backward
propagation processes for a neural network with 784 inputs and 10 outputs
using NumPy. This network can be thought of as consisting of 10 perceptrons,
each responsible for predicting one of the 10 output classes.

Given an input matrix X of shape (m, 784), where m is the batch size and 784
is the number of features (input neurons), a weight matrix W of shape (784, 10),
and a bias matrix b of shape (10, ), compute the output of the network for each
example in the batch, calculate the error, and update the weights and biases
accordingly.

Download the MNIST dataset, load the images, and propagate them through
your network. Record the initial prediction accuracy before training and the
prediction accuracy after training for a specified number of epochs.

1. Load the MNIST dataset.
2. Normalize the data and convert the labels to one-hot-encoding.
3. Train the perceptron for 50-500 epochs.
      â€¢ For each epoch, split the training data and training labels into batches of 100 elements.
      â€¢ For each batch, compute the output of the network using the softmax function. (3 points)
      â€¢ Implement the gradient descent algorithm to update the weights and biases. (7 points)
      â€¢ Have an efficient implementation. (2 points)
      â€¢ Achieve at least 90% accuracy on the testing data. (3 points)
